Basic plan is to create a simple but polished todo task app.

--------------------------------------
        FUNCTIONALLITY

It will eventually have CRUD (create,read,update,destroy) functionally but I will break it up into two phases of development.

Stage 1: Create & Destroy
    Step 1: I will first create a simple app allowing text input which creates a task in a list.
    Step 2: I will create a delete button to delete and task chosen from the list.

Stage 2: Read & update
    Step 1: Each task will be given the ability to have "subtasks" allowing the user to break down each task into further smaller tasks.
    Step 2: I will make this presentable(reveal) to the user after then they click on the chosen parent task (read).
    Step 3: Each aspect of the task parent & child tasks will be made editable after clicking on an edit icon.

            STYLE NOTES

As stated above I want this to be a basic but polished app.
List to be centred on the page and use minimalist design principles, good use of negative space etc.
muted colours, no need to be over the top.
Simple animations, colour fades, pop in/ pop out etc just to give it a slight pop.

--------------------------------------

Further Ideas:
    Idea 1: Save to local storage so that the todo list can persist and the user can come back to it.
    Idea 2: Track completed/incomplete etc tasks to give the user broader data on how productive they are being.
